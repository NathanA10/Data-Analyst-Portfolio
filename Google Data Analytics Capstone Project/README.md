**Introduction**

Bellabeat is a tech company that is focused on manufacturing health-related products for women. One of their main goals is to build and improve smart devices that can track activity, stress and sleep of the user.

**Ask Phase**

The purpose of this project is to analyze the usage of smart device tracker and apply these findings to Bellabeat's Leaf wellness tracker. It will give insights on how consumers use non-Bellabeat devices.

The main focus of this analysis will:

* Determine various trends in the smart device usage
* Identify how the trends in Fitbit consumers can apply to Bellabeat consumers
* Determine how the trends can support Bellabeat marketing strategy

**Dataset**

The public dataset “FitBit Fitness Tracker Data” from Kaggle is provided to explore the fitness tracker of thirty FitBit users. This dataset contained data that tracked the activity, sleep and weight of the users. 
 
There are limitations to this public dataset and it’s important to have this consideration during the analysis and recommendation.
